PHP OOP & Exception Handling – Summary
1️⃣ What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.

Example:

class Car {
    public $color;

    public function drive() {
        echo "The car is moving";
    }
}


Car → class name

$color → property (variable inside class)

drive() → method (function inside class)

2️⃣ What is an Object?

An object is an instance of a class.

$car = new Car();


$car → object

new → creates the object

We use -> to access properties and methods:

$car->color = "Red";
$car->drive();


-> means: “access something inside the object”

3️⃣ Properties vs Methods

Property = variable inside a class

Method = function inside a class

Example:

$this->balance


$this refers to the current object

->balance accesses the property

4️⃣ Constructor

A constructor runs automatically when we create an object.

public function __construct($amount) {
    $this->balance = $amount;
}


It initializes the object with starting values.

5️⃣ Example: BankAccount
class BankAccount {
    private $balance;

    public function __construct($amount) {
        $this->balance = $amount;
    }

    public function withdraw($money) {
        if ($money > $this->balance) {
            throw new Exception("Not enough money");
        }

        $this->balance -= $money;
        echo "Withdrawal successful. New balance: " . $this->balance;
    }
}


Create object:

$account = new BankAccount(100);


Withdraw:

$account->withdraw(50);


If money > balance → exception
If money <= balance → withdrawal successful

6️⃣ What is an Exception?

An exception is an error that stops normal program execution.

We use:

throw → to create an exception

try → to test code

catch → to handle the error

Example:

try {
    $account->withdraw(150);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}


throw sends the error

catch receives it

$e->getMessage() returns the error message

7️⃣ Symbols Explained

-> → access property or method from object

:: → access static property or method

$this → refers to the current object

new → creates object

throw → creates exception

try / catch → handles exceptions

8️⃣ PDO Database Connection (What We Did Before)
$conn = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;port=3307;dbname=local_db", "root", "");
$conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);


PDO is a class

$conn is an object

setAttribute() is a method

PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE uses :: because it is static

PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION tells PDO to throw exceptions

If connection fails:

catch(PDOException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
