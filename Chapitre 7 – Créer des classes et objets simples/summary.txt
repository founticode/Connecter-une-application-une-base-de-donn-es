PHP OOP – Classes and Objects Summary
1️⃣ What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.

It defines:

Properties (variables)

Methods (functions inside a class)

Example:

class Car {
    public $color;
    
    public function drive() {
        echo "The car is driving";
    }
}
2️⃣ What is an Object?

An object is an instance of a class.

We create an object using the keyword new.

$car1 = new Car();

Now $car1 is an object created from the Car class.

3️⃣ Properties (Attributes)

Properties are variables inside a class.
They store data related to the object.

Example:

class Phone {
    public $brand;
}

$p1 = new Phone();
$p1->brand = "iPhone";

echo $p1->brand;

Here:

brand is a property

-> is used to access properties or methods

Each object has its own property values.

4️⃣ Methods

A method is a function defined inside a class.

Example:

class Calculator {

    public function add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }
}

$calc = new Calculator();
echo $calc->add(5, 3);

Here:

add() is a method

We call it using ->

5️⃣ Accessing Properties and Methods (->)

The arrow operator -> is used to access:

Object properties

Object methods

Example:

$car1->color = "Red";
$car1->drive();
6️⃣ Difference Between Function and Method

A function exists outside a class.

A method is a function inside a class.

Example:

function sayHello() {
    echo "Hello";
}

class Test {
    public function sayHello() {
        echo "Hello";
    }
}

The second one is a method because it belongs to a class.

7️⃣ Public vs Private

public → accessible from outside the class
private → accessible only inside the class

Example:

class BankAccount {

    private $balance = 100;

    public function getBalance() {
        return $this->balance;
    }
}

$account = new BankAccount();
echo $account->getBalance();

You cannot do:

echo $account->balance; // Error

Because $balance is private.

Final Key Idea

A class defines structure.

An object stores real data.

Properties store information.

Methods perform actions.

-> connects the object to its data and behavior.

Access modifiers (public/private) control visibility.
